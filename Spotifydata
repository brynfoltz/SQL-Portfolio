--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle, created a table and inserted the data, then ran SQL to get the following answers. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB4.Spotifydata;

--1. Determine average energy, danceability, popularity, and duration by the artist name and track name. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, 
avg(energy), 
avg(danceability), 
avg(popularity), 
avg(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB4.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--2. What are all the songs by Olivia Rodrigo in the data?

SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB4.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo';

--3. Who were the top 5 artists and songs of the year (by popularity)?
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB4.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5; 

--Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
--Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, 
--their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS
(SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name)

SELECT artist_name, 
average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
